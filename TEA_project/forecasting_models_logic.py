        DECOMPOSITION:
        - Trend identification (linear, exponential, polynomial)
        - Seasonality detection (additive, multiplicative)
        - Cyclical patterns recognition
        - Irregular/random component isolation
        
        MODEL SELECTION:
        - Stationary data: ARIMA models
        - Non-stationary: Differencing + ARIMA
        - Seasonal patterns: SARIMA
        - Multiple variables: VAR models

        - Simple linear regression
        - Multiple regression with economic indicators
        - Polynomial regression for non-linear trends
        - Ridge/Lasso for high-dimensional data
        
        FEATURE ENGINEERING:
        - Lagged variables
        - Moving averages
        - Economic indicators integration
